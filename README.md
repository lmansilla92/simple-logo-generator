# Simple Logo Generator

## Repository

In this repository you will find the application code to a simple logo generator. The purpose of this application is to generate a simple logo based on user input using inquirer to prompt for user input, then writing a logo.svg file using the fs module which uses svg to make a logo. A series of questions are asked after typing node index.js in the integrated terminal to gather the user input consisting of text to be displayed, shape of the logo, color of the text and the shape chosen. Once the input data has been gathered, this application uses fs to write an svg file.
